## Installation

1. Install Python 3.11 or above.
2. Clone the repository to your desired location or download the ZIP and extract it.
3. Recommended: Launch `run.bat`(for Windows). This will set up a new virtual environment and install all dependencies.

   **Or**

   - Install dependencies manually using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Launch `main.py`.

## Tutorial

1. Create a new password for the vault. The script will generate a new folder ('data') in your current directory, which stores all encrypted files when imported to the vault.
2. Import files to the vault.
3. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚

**Note:** For enhanced data privacy, the application does not include an auto-update module. Once it installs all dependencies, it operates offline. Please visit [here](https://github.com/sdmdg/vaultapp/) to manually check for and install updates.

## Deleting the Vault

1. First, decrypt and move your files to a secure location.
2. Delete the 'data' folder.
